In order to run this code make sure to run this code:

1) run "make all"
this step will run the code and compile it into a system compilable code
2)run ".\a4 <input.dimacs> output.txt"
<input.dimacs> can be rmat15.dimacs, road-NY.dimacs, wiki.dimacs
output.txt file will have all the nodes and their weights
3)Make sure to go into the main.py file and change the .dimacs file to the one you are using on line 83
4) run "python main.py"
to get the graph and histogram for the file you are using. Works best for wiki.dimacs
